## Project Name:
* Decentralized Crowdfunding DApp 



## Project Abstract
This project is blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform built on the Polygon Amoy Testnet. 
It allows user to create fundraising campaigns, donate using MATIC, and earn NFT rewards based on their contribution level.

key features:
* Campaign creation with goal, category, and deadline.
* Secure crypto donation via Metamask/ WalletConnect.
* Automatic refunds if the Campaign goal is not met by the deadline.
* NFT reward badges(Bronze, Silver, Gold) for donors.
* Real-time updates on Campaign progress, donor lists, and NFTS earned.



## Tech Stack
* **Blockchain & Smart Contract**: Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin(ERC721).
* **Network**: Polygon Amoy Testnet
* **Backend**:  Node.js,  MongoDB, Ethers.js, Express.js
* **Frontend**:  React.js, TailwindCSS, Web3.js/Ethers.js
* **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, WalletConnnect
* **Deployment**: Hardhat, Render, Vercel(Next.js), MongoDB Atlas
  
 ## Dataset Used
* Campaign and donation data are stored in the backend database like MongoDB.
* Blockchain Events are fetched directly from the Polygon Amoy Smart Contract


## About Blockchain

* Blockchain is a decentralized and transparent digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and immutable way. 
* Unlike traditional centralized systems where a single authority controls data, blockchain distributes control among participants (nodes),
ensuring that all transactions are tamper-proof, verifiable, and traceable.

* In this project, the Polygon Amoy Testnet (a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum) is used to deploy smart contracts.Polygon provides faster transactions and lower gas fees while maintaining the same security model as Ethereum.

The blockchain layer in this DApp is responsible for:
* Recording campaign creation and donations transparently.
* Enforcing rules for campaign success, deadlines, and refunds via smart contracts.
* Issuing NFT rewards to donors without intermediaries.
* Ensuring trust — no party can alter or manipulate transactions once recorded.

By leveraging blockchain technology, this project ensures that crowdfunding is open, secure, and decentralized, removing the need for traditional banks or platforms to manage funds.
